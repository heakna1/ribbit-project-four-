Want to start a new hobby but not sure what? Already have a hobby, but want to know more? Try Ribbit!
Ribbit is a forum for hobbyists to use and explore, to share and learn, and to just have fun!
Users can create threads about a specific subject and then other users can create posts to branch off of them. 
And before you know it, you're having so much froggy fun!
